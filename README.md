# polyu_wifi_auto_connect
Auto connect "Wi-Fi.HK via PolyU"

##Features

* No three-party library needed
* Only tested on Linux(ubuntu)



## TODO

* Not efficient enough, the script tests the Internet connection every 15 min, if lost, reconnects. A better approach may catch some signal from the system in order to reconnect instantly when connection lost.
